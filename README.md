 # Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction
Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis project! This project focuses on sentiment analysis of tweets using text pre-processing, vector tokenizing, and machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 1.26 million tweets sourced from Twitter API via Kaggle. It's available at [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140).

### Files
- `sentiment_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- `dataset.csv`: CSV file containing the raw data.

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis.
2. **Vector Tokenizing**: Converting text data into numerical vectors for machine learning algorithms.
3. **Model Building**: Training various machine learning models for sentiment classification.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Deployment**: Deploying the best-performing model for sentiment analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open and run the `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook.

## Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 86.7% on the test set.
